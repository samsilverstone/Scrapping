# Scrapping
Scrapping the titles of Imdb movies.
To make this script work, you had to have the imdb dataset==>title.ratings.tsv.gz which can be downloaded from here(https://datasets.imdbws.com/). It is basically a 'xslx' file in which there are three columns (tconst,averageRating,numvotes) where tconst is the serial no. of the movie. 
The goal of this script is to extract the title of the movies so that you know which rating belongs to which movie or tv show.
